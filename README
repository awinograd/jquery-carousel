Hey! This project is a carousel jQuery plugin. However, rather than a "featured-image" type carousel, this is the type of carousel that lets your scroll through a list of items.

The carousel is implemented using solely jQuery and CSS. There are no images. The provided CSS can serve as a finished product or a boilerplate for customization. There are some styles that are required to not look broken, but many are just there for extra aesthetics.

All you have to do in order to use it is link to the js and css files as you normally would and call:

' javascript
  $(element_containing_carousel_members).Carousel();
'

Necessary CSS styles:
'children must float: left;'
