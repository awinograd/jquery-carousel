Hey! This project is a carousel for a jQuery plugin. However, rather than a "featured-image" type carousel, this is the type of carousel that lets your scroll through a list of items.

The carousel is implemented using solely jQuery and CSS. There are no images. The provided CSS can serve as a finished product or a boilerplate for customization. There are some styles that are required to not look broken, but many are just there for extra aesthetics.
